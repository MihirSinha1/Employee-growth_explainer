'Target Pay Comparison.png': "The graph shows the salary trends for Employee 1 over time, comparing their current salary to various benchmarks, specifically the Radford, Mercer, and Internal salary curves.\n\n1.
 **Current Salary** (red line): Employee 1’s salary starts significantly lower than the benchmark salaries but gradually increases over time. It appears to remain below the other curves for the entire period represented.\n\n2.

  **Team Range**: The blue line tracks the team's salary range and shows a gradual upward trend over time, reflecting either salary adjustments for the team or inflations in compensation standards.\n\n3. 
  **Revised Team Range**: The orange line, representing the revised team salary range, is consistently above the team range, indicating that adjustments have been made to the salary expectations or competitive benchmarks for the team.\n\n4.
   **Revised Salary**: The green line indicates the revised salary for Employee 1, which is positioned much higher than the initial current salary. Over time, this line also trends upward, suggesting that Employee 1 is aligning more closely with the changes in the team and revised ranges.\n\n5. 
   **Comparison**: As the time progresses, it becomes evident that while Employee 1's salary has been increasing, it initially lagged behind the team range. However, with revisions and upward trends in both team ranges, Employee 1's salary starts to close the gap.\n\n
   Overall, the graph illustrates that Employee 1's compensation is improving, reflecting adjustments and possibly aligning with performance or market rates. The initial low salary followed by increases suggests a strategic move to retain and incentivize Employee 1 within the context of the team's shifting salary landscape."}
